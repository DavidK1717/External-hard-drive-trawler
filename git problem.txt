I solved this issue by downloading the latest version of the git credential manager, and copying the contents of the zip file gcmw-v1.14.0.zip from:

https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/tag/v1.14.0



To path:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer\Git\mingw32\libexec\git-core
